The path find function with the health condition can be used for the path find function without the health condition.
We can simply assign positive infine to health for normal maze problem Or it could be checked with an if else condition.
But, I wanted to show it separately. If I run the normal maze problem on the same function, it would be a little more difficult to read the code.


I added the value "IsDead" For the condition in which the health condition is observed.If she/he cant find a way. Recursion terminated
If he/she have no move and he/she doesn't in F letter,he/she cant find way.
If she/he reaches the letter H before she runs out of health and continues on the road, her/him health is maxed and  reduced by 1 for the next step.

I passed it as an extra parameter to keep the maximum health status recursive in the function with the health condition.
